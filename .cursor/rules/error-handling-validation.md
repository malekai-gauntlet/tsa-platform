# Error Handling and Validation

## Form Validation

- Use Zod for schema validation
- Implement error messages
- Use form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

## Error Boundaries

- Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully
- Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging
- Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app
