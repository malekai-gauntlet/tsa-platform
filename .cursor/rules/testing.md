# Testing

## Unit Testing

- Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for reliable and efficient testing of React components
- Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert to ensure clarity and consistency in tests
- Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests

## Integration Testing

- Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality
- Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence
- Use snapshot testing selectively to catch unintended UI changes without over-relying on it
- Leverage testing utilities (e.g., screen in RTL) for cleaner and more readable tests
