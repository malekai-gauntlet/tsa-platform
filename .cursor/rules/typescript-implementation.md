# TypeScript Implementation

## Core Guidelines
- Enable strict mode
- Define clear interfaces for component props, state, and Redux state structure
- Use type guards to handle potential undefined or null values safely
- Apply generics to functions, actions, and slices where type flexibility is needed
- Utilize TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) for cleaner and reusable code
- Prefer interface over type for defining object structures, especially when extending
- Use mapped types for creating variations of existing types dynamically
