# TSA Platform Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Analysis Phase

- ✅ Identified duplicate UI components
- ✅ Found duplicate utility functions
- ✅ Identified overlapping types and interfaces
- ✅ Located redundant files with similar functionality
- ✅ Examined duplicate hooks and service files

### 2. Component Consolidation

- ✅ Created migration guide for Button components
- ✅ Migrated Button component in `/app/coach/settings/page.tsx`
- ✅ Created ExtendedBadge component for backwards compatibility
- ✅ Created Badge migration guide
- ✅ Migrated Badge component in `/components/dashboard-steps/bootcamp-step.tsx`

## Remaining Tasks

### Component Consolidation

- ⬜ Complete Button migration in remaining files:
  - `/app/coach/marketing/components/ResourceModal.tsx`
  - `/app/coach/events/create/page.tsx`
  - `/app/coach/events/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `/app/coach/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- ⬜ Complete Badge migration in remaining files:
  - `/app/coach/settings/page.tsx`
  - `/components/dashboard-steps/review-materials-step.tsx`
  - `/components/dashboard-steps/host-events-step.tsx`
  - `/components/dashboard-steps/find-real-estate-step.tsx`
  - `/app/coach/events/[id]/page.tsx`
- ⬜ Consolidate Input components
- ⬜ Consolidate Select components
- ⬜ Consolidate Table components
- ⬜ Consolidate Checkbox components

### Utility Function Centralization

- ⬜ Create centralized date utility file (`lib/utils/dates.ts`)
- ⬜ Create centralized color/status utility file (`lib/utils/status.ts`)
- ⬜ Create centralized validation utility file (`lib/utils/validation.ts`)

### Type Definition Standardization

- ⬜ Standardize Event interface
- ⬜ Standardize Application types
- ⬜ Standardize Onboarding/Invitation data types
- ⬜ Create common Address interface
- ⬜ Standardize Status enums

### Service File Optimization

- ⬜ Create centralized GraphQL operations
- ⬜ Consolidate authentication logic
- ⬜ Standardize data transformation patterns

## Next Steps

1. Continue Button and Badge component migrations
2. Tackle the Input component consolidation
3. Create utility function centralizations (starting with date utilities)
4. Standardize interfaces starting with Event interface

## Notes

- Build verification revealed an issue with `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider` package that should be addressed separately
- The ExtendedBadge approach allows maintaining backwards compatibility while standardizing on the newer UI component system
- Component migration guides help ensure consistent approach across files
